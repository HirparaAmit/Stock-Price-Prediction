# Stock-Price-Prediction

In this project I create a code to predict close price of stocks using Linear regression and Random Forest method. For that I used 'stock exchange data' dataset which is publicaly available on Kaggle.

I just want to compare these two methods and want to know that which method performs better.

If you want to know that which method performs better than go and read `.ipynb` file.

Note : You can find that there is some code cells without their outputs. So if you want to see their outputs then you have to run this `.ipynb` file by yourself.
